# LPBF Optimizer Development Roadmap

## Completed Tasks ‚úì
- [x] Implement core PINN architecture for thermal modeling
- [x] Develop synthetic data generation pipeline
- [x] Establish basic NSGA-III optimization framework

## In Progress Tasks ‚åõ
- [ ] Integrate Bayesian optimization alternative
- [ ] Implement experimental validation workflow
- [ ] Develop parameter bounds configuration system

## Next Priority Tasks ‚è©
1. [ ] Create automated Pareto front analysis module
2. [ ] Implement manufacturing constraint validation
3. [ ] Develop process stability metrics system

## Future Considerations üîÆ
- Multi-scale modeling integration
- In-situ monitoring data assimilation
- Cloud-based optimization service

## Pending Dependencies
‚ñ≥ Requires completion of experimental validation workflow
‚ñ≥ Awaiting XRD equipment calibration data
